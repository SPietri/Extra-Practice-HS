##### IMPORTANT: Use the code for the function "norm2" 
##### "raw" is the dataset that had all the counts for census 

# NORMALIZE
# Normalize the data. 

# What I can see from HS code is to normalize the data you want to
# 1) vi = the feature OR the variable 
# 2) pi = the pop ulation of the tract
# 3) you want to multiply these together 
# 4) then create a combined sum for the feature using all tracts 
# 5) then divide the answer found in #3 by the answer in #4 
# That will give you the normalized value

# Let's Go! But first I need to know which variables we are doing this for...
# I'm importing the hs_census_raw file as "raw" 
# HS codes beautigully so I am going to follow her code. She uses the function mutate and saves the total poulation as
# is own object value. The only problem I see if that, I'm not sure If I am advanced enough to create a function for this.We
# will try. 

# The function needs to 
# 1) grab the feature
# 2) multiply it by the population
# 3) make that a new variable
# 4) sum that new variable
# 5) divide the variable created in 3 by the one created in 4
# 6) and save that as a new variable in the data set
# 7) have it iterate over all the columns. 
# A good idea here would have been to use purr but honestl y I have no time
